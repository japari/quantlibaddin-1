This repository consists of two different source code types:  python code 
(for c++ code generation) and  c++ code (to compile the addin for LibreOffice/Calc). 

The python code for generating the addin c++ source code is under GPLv3 
(see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses>), the generated c++ source code is under 
the QuantLib license (see <http://quantlib.org/license.shtml>) [for the 
total view: one Makefile for addin code compilation is  a modified copy of 
a makefile used in the examples of the LibreOffice SDK and under the BSD 
license].

So what you can do (and I think most of you will do): generate the c++ 
code (or use the generated  code) in the Calc directory which is under the 
QuantLib license (and if you provide source code look at the BSD license of 
the Makefile) and compile and install the addin. The license of the c++ code 
is just the license used for QuantLib in the community (see QuantLib license 
for details).  

But: I have spent some time to write the python code for the c++ source 
code generation. I am interested in CopyLeft in the license and so the 
relevant part of the repository (the folders code/ and metadata/) are under 
the GPLv3 so that anybody can use and extent it â€“ but has to be aware of 
the CopyLeft. 

Please be aware of my intended distinction between python code generation 
(GPLv3) and c++ code for the addin compilation (QuantLib license).
